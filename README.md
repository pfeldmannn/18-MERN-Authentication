# 18-MERN-Authentication

### Description
I refactored a book search engine that originally used a RESTful API into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This application was built using the MERN stack, featuring a React front end, a MongoDB database, and a Node.js/Express.js server. Users can sign up or log in to search for books and save them to their profile. In the 'See Your Books' tab, logged-in users can view or remove their saved books. If not logged in, users can still search for books but cannot save them.
